Overview
--------

    The **User Profile Page** add-on creates a user profile page with a profile image and personal information with the ability to edit the profile and add third-party blocks.

    Every user will have their own Profile page which may be reached from the top right menu (My Account - My profile page). This page contains links to further pages allowing the user to edit their profile information and preferences, manage their Wish list, Comparison list, orders, etc.

    Here's what the user will see in their profile:

    .. note::

        The image above shows two third-party blocks: **Products that you've liked** (added by the `Product Likes <https://www.simtechdev.com/docs/addons/product_likes/index.html>`_ add-on) and **Vendor news** (added by the `Follow Vendor <https://www.simtechdev.com/docs/addons/follow_vendor/index.html>`_ add-on).

    Users can add a profile image in the Profile details.
