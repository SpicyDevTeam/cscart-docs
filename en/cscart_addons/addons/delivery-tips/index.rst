Overview
--------

    Allow your customers to add a tip during checkout with our **Delivery Tips** add-on. You can humbly ask your customers to tip couriers or drivers, and adjust the amount according to their preference. This will be especially convenient for customers who want to add a tip from their credit card right away rather than give tips in cash upon delivery.

    Customers will see an optional field for delivery tips at the Shipping options step at checkout. The total shipping cost will be updated automatically after a customer changes the value of the Tips input field.
