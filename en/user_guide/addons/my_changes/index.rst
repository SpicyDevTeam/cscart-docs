This add-on enables CS-Cart to keep track of changes that you make in the code of the store. Changes are kept in the directory *<cscart_dir>/app/addons/my_changes*, and the changes are applied as a separate add-on. This considerably simplifies the upgrade process.

For instructions and recommendations on how to customize CS-Cart, please refer to the `Developer Guide <http://docs.cs-cart.com/latest/developer_guide/index.html>`_.
