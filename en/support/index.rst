About our support
-------------------

    Hi! We are glad to know that you are interested in purchasing (if not already purchased) our products. We are doing our best for you by creating add-ons, and we really like it.
    Furthermore, we want our add-ons to be useful to you. It’s quite common for every one of us to ask ourselves “How does it work?” or “What should I do next?” about some new and unfamiliar things.
    For this very reason, we created the Support Center. It aims to cover such kinds of questions about our add-ons. It is based on the experience of our managers and developers, and on real cases of our clients.
    If you have a question about any of our add-ons, welcome, the answer is waiting for you here.

Free queries for consultation include

    * Advisory questions on add-ons that do not require individual verification at the customer’s store
    * Response to the inquiry within 3-5 business days
    * Documentation, instructions, and descriptions for the add-ons

 If you report a bug
+++++++++++++++++++++

    * Add a full description of the misconduct, screenshots and step-by-step explanation of how it can be recreated on default software
    * Creating a service request for verification, 3-5 days
    * If the problem is reproduced on the default installation, a task is created in the backlog, for investigation. All improvements are made according to prioritization.
    * If the problem can’t be recreated, an additional customer’s store check will be required. This will be done as part of an incident or subscription to Technical Support.
