About our support
-------------------

    Hi! We are glad to know that you are interested in purchasing (if not already purchased) our products. We are doing our best for you by creating add-ons, and we really like it.
    Furthermore, we want our add-ons to be useful to you. It’s quite common for every one of us to ask ourselves “How does it work?” or “What should I do next?” about some new and unfamiliar things.
    For this very reason, we created the Support Center. It aims to cover such kinds of questions about our add-ons. It is based on the experience of our managers and developers, and on real cases of our clients.
    If you have a question about any of our add-ons, welcome, the answer is waiting for you here.

    **In order to contact our technical support, please follow these steps:**

    * Submit your request in your Help desk system account at `<https://helpdesk.cs-cart.com/>`_;
    * To get there, you need to log in with the email address with which you purchased the add-on/theme and password. If you don't remember the password, you can use the **Forgot the password?** link;
    * Fill in the data with the issue (describe the steps of reproducing the issue, screenshots and examples will be appreciated);
    * You can provide us with a store administration panel and the SSH/SFTP access to the server where your store is located so that we ​could examine the issue in your store in more detail;
    * Please use the secure "Access information" page of our Help Desk system `<https://helpdesk.cs-cart.com/>`_ in order to provide sensitive access information. You can just click on the "Add record" link on the "Access information" page and fill in access credentials;
    * Wait for the answer of the specialist in accordance with the SLA (Service Level Agreement) of the technical support service and the priority of your ticket (we work Mon-Fri, 9AM-6PM, our local time is UTC+4.).
